# Spark Testing
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ccaspanello/spark-testing.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ccaspanello/spark-testing)

Project to learn how to effectively develop and test Spark applications.

## Building
This is a Maven based project.  Simply run `mvn clean install`

## Running
There are a few options here:
* Run it from the unit test (which is the goal of this project)
* Run on Spark with the `spark-submit.sh` script (see Spark documentation for that)
* Run the `Main.main()` method from your IDE or java command line
